# Analysis-of-US-Graduate-Schools-Admission-Predictive-Modeling

### This project aims to find out the most correlated features with successful master admissions. By doing bivariate analysis in heat maps and scatterplots, I have identified the most influential feature variables that could potentially increase one's successful admission rate. 

### At the end, prediction is made for successful master admissions with over 86% training score using Linear Regression, rather than XGBoost. A dummy student was put on the test at the end for extensive purpose.
