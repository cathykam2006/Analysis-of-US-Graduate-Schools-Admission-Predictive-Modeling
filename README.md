# Analysis of US Graduate Schools Admission + Predictive Modeling
Introduction
This project aims to analyze the admissions data of graduate schools in the United States and build a predictive model to predict the chances of admission for an applicant. The dataset used for this project contains information about the applicant's GRE scores, GPA, and the rank of their undergraduate school, among other things.

Data Preparation
The data used in this project was obtained from a publicly available dataset from Kaggle called 'US graduate school admission', collected by Mohan S Acharya, Asfia Armaan and Aneeta S. Antony collectively. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to remove any missing or irrelevant data. The data was then split into training and testing sets.

Data Exploration
Exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the distribution of the data and the relationships between different variables. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps and box plots were used to gain insights into the data.

Predictive Modeling
A predictive model were built using the training data. The model was trained using different algorithms such as Linear regression and XGBoost. Model performance was evaluated using R2 score.

Results
The model was able to achieve an R2 score of 0.86 on the training data, indicating that the model is able to predict the chances of admission with a high degree of accuracy.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project was able to analyze the admissions data of graduate schools in the United States and build a predictive model that can predict the chances of admission with a high degree of accuracy. The model can be used by graduate schools to help them make more informed decisions about admissions.

Additional Information
The project is implemented in python and the libraries used are Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
